## //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// :active

The `:active` pseudo-class (pseudo selector) represents an element (such as button) that is being activated by the user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button.

The `:active` pseudo-class is commonly used on `<a>` and `<button>` elements.

**Note:**Styles defined by the `:active` pseudo-class will be overridden by any subsequent link-related pseudo-class(`:link`, `:hover`, or `:visited`) that has at least equal specificity.

To style links appropriately, put the `:active` rule after all other link-related rules, as defined by the (_LoVe-HAte_-order): `:link` - `:visited` - `:hover` - `:active`.
